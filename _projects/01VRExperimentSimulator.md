This project was completed as part of my [high school research internship at RIT](/work/RIT_Intern/).
In this I parsed through a data set that was collected when a previous eye coordination experiment was done.
I used this data to recreate what occured during the experiment in a virtual reality simulation so that it could be further studied.
I drew out the virtual world and pieces and moved them according to the data however, I also added a progress bar that could be adjusted as if the simulation were a video, an overlaid graph of the saccade analysis, and a frame counter.
The code for this can be found in [RIT-Gaze-Study repository](https://github.com/vlthrasher/RIT-Gaze-Study).
