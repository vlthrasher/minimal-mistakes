This was a project done for ICS 46.  The GUI and base was given to us but we created an intelligent opponent.  This opponent had to make decisions with knowledge gained immediately and not carried over and had to do so in 3 seconds of processing power or less.  My project used a minimax traversal starting at the current status of the board.  I was able to allow the tree to go to depth 5 in order to keep the decision time under 3 seconds.  My project ended up scoring in the top 30% when competing against classmates' projects.
