This project was done as a final project for the computer vision project class I took.  Traditionally, milk scanners provide a way of using computer vision and liquid to gather topographic mappings of an object from a given angle.  When these topographic mappings are taken from different angles and combined they can create a single 3D point mapping of that object.  These topographic mappings are gathered by placing a camera directly above an object and slowly raising the level of a liquid surrounding that object.  I used a white ceramic dog statue and Dr. Pepper for my project.
