This project takes data about all of the user's expected classes including lectures, discussions, rooms, etc. and performs a depth-first recursive algorithm to find all combinations of all the expected classes that result in a non conflicting schedule.  From there, users can limit the schedules they are presented by suggesting a later start time or earlier end time or a lunch break for example.

Potential Future Developements: 
- Gather data from online rather than user input
- Add a neural network to suggest better schedules without asking the user
- Create a website to handle the front-end so it can become public
- Design a better GUI to present schedules
