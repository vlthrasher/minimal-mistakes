This project was done as part of the [ISG](https://isg.ics.uci.edu/) research group at UCI.  It used C++ to determine how to apply k-means clustering to large, geographic, social media data so it could be more optimally visualized.  The first step was applying k-means clustering to point data and the second step was applying k-means clustering to edge data.  After the distance formulas were optimized, we added threading to further increase the speed of the computations.
