This was a project I started as the final project to my high school Java class.  I continued adding features and cleaning up the interface until in February of the following year, I released free versions to any of the professionals working in my high school so that they could use it as a teaching aid.

You can begin by designing a game by setting the board size and adding questions and answers and a a scoring format.  You can then play the game by creating teams.  As you go through questions, you click buttons for whether a team answered correctly or incorrectly which automatically keeps track of points.

Additionally, I made a [tutorial video](https://youtu.be/AAEaTOdmUGM) to demonstrate how to use the software.
