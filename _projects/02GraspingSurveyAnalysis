The project was done in python during my [Oregon State REU intership](https://vlthrasher.github.io/work/4OSU/).  We were looking for “fuzzy” size boundaries at which people believed an object would no longer be able to be held assuming a certain grasp type and approach direction.  We developed a survey to ask this question using a variety of objects and grasps.  After receiving about 30 responses (we didn’t feel more was necessary as we were only needed “fuzzy” boundaries), we studied the data and looked at which boundaries were the most consistent across people.  Physical representations were then made out of cardboard of the shapes that had the most consistent boundaries so that they could be used in in-person user studies to gather more detailed and exact boundaries.
