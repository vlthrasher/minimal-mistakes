This project was done as a part of my project for my [internship with Amazon](/work/AmazonIntern/).  I used JHipster, Typescript, Java, React, and Spring to create a full stack website.  The purpose of this website was to aid other teams inside Amazon who had confusion when using our team’s services.  It would take a product’s codes and produce the formulas our team used to determine how the prices were set.  Then, if the other team still had a problem with a number, they could contact the correct team about it.
