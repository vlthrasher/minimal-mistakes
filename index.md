My name is Victoria Thrasher and I am a recent graduate of the University of California, Irvine. Currently, I am interested in artificial intelligence and graphics but I have found myself to enjoy most interdisciplinary fields within computer science including computer vision, virtual reality, and full-stack web development.

I have used many coding languages including Python, C++, C, Java, and Javascript. I am also currently working on picking up C#. I have also worked with many IDE's and text editors including Eclipse, Canopy, Visual Studio, and have worked with both Windows and Linux based systems.

I have used these interests to develop a few projects including an Othello and Wumpus World AI as well as a troubleshooting website for my internship last summer at Amazon.

If you want to know more, feel free to poke around the site to get a better idea of who I am and what I do!
