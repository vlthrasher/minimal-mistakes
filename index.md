My name is Victoria Thrasher and I am currently a third year student at the University of California, Irvine.  Currently I am interested in artificial intelligence and computer vision but I have found myself to enjoy most interdisciplinary fields within computer science including robotics and virtual reality.

I have used many coding languages including Python, C++, C, and Java.  I am also currently working on picking up C# and Javascript.  I have also worked with many IDE's and text editors including Eclipse, Canopy, Visual Studio, and have working with both Windows and Linux based systems.

I have used these interests to develop a few projects including a perfect class scheduler and an Othello AI as well as an OpenRAVE GUI for my internship last summer at Oregon State University.

If you want to know more, feel free to poke around the site to get a better idea of who I am and what I do!
