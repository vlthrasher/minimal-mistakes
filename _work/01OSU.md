I worked here as an REU summer intern during the summer between the sophomore and junior year of college.  I worked under [Dr. Cindy Grimm](http://mime.oregonstate.edu/people/grimm) in the Grasping Lab.  I helped gather rendered images and develop a survey, as well as analyze the results of said survey, in order to better understand the connection between the shape and size of objects and the grasps that humans use.  This process was seperated into two main projects: [OpenRAVE Interface](https://vlthrasher.github.io/projects/03OpenRAVEInterface/) and [Grasping Survey Analysis](https://vlthrasher.github.io/projects/02GraspingSurveyAnalysis/).  A total representation of this work can be seen in my [final powerpoint](../assets/Final_Presentation.pdf)
