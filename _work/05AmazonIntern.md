I worked here as a software engineering intern on the procurement team during the summer between my junior and senior years of college (2018).  I had one project that I worked on relatively independently which included writing a design document, a midterm presentation and a final presentation given to the rest of the team.  The [project](/TroubleshootSite/) was to setup a full stack website that could be used by other teams to troubleshoot issues they had with procurementâ€™s software.
