I worked here as an unpaid high school intern during the summer between my junior and senior year.  I did research under [Dr. Gabriel Diaz](https://www.rit.edu/science/people/gabriel-diaz) in the PerForM Lab studying visual guidance of action.  During this time I worked on two projects: a [Saccade Analysis](https://vlthrasher.github.io/projects/09SaccadeAnalysis/) and [VR Experiment Simulator](https://vlthrasher.github.io/projects/10VRExperimentSimulator/)
