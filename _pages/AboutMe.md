##Computer Science
I have always enjoyed making things.  When I was really young, I would make water slides for my dolls but I would always become frustrated with my lack of access to the right materials.  Computer Science allowed me to make things without having those material limitations.  When I was in middle school and high school I began coding with coding camps my school's Java class.  My senior year I challenged the AP Computer Science exam and recieved a 4.

Even when I first began looking at computer science topics, I realized that I was not that interested in hardware or security but I was really interested in Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision.  I am still really interested in these fields however I have also broadened by interested to include many interdisciplinary fields like Robotics and Virtual Reality.

#Other Interests
In addition to being a student, I am also the president of the women's club volleyball team at UCI.  I have played volleyball in high school since 7th grade and I have played junior club volleyball for 7 years before comeing to UCI.  In high school, I even volunteer coached the U10 team for my club.

I really enjoy reading.  My favorite books include Ender's Game, Where the Red Fern Grows, and Marley and Me.  I tend to lean towards Sci-Fy and Fantasy and lean away from historical fiction, however, I am open to reading pretty much anything someone recommends.

I also really enjoy competitive reality shows like The Amazing Race, Survivor, Masterchef, and Project Runway.
