## Computer Science
I have always enjoyed making things. When I was really young, I would make water slides for my dolls but I would always become frustrated with my lack of access to the right materials. Computer Science allowed me to make things without having those material limitations. When I was in middle school and high school I began coding with coding camps and my high school's Java class. My senior year I challenged the AP Computer Science exam (self-study without a class) and received a 4.

Even when I first began looking at computer science topics, I realized that I was really interested in artificial intelligence and graphics. I am still really interested in these fields however I have also broadened by interested to include many interdisciplinary fields like computer vision and virtual reality.

## Other Interests
I have played volleyball since 6th grade and was a starter on my high school’s varsity team for 3 years.  While I was in college I played for UCI’s club team and was the president of the club for my junior and senior years.  I have also volunteer-coached many U10 and U14 teams.

I recently started practicing aerial arts (circus arts).  I’ve tried lyra and static trapeze but my current favorite are the silks.

I really enjoy reading. My favorite books include Ender's Game and the Harry Potter series. I tend to lean towards Sci-Fi and Fantasy and lean away from romance, however, I am open to reading pretty much anything someone recommends.

I also really enjoy competitive reality shows like The Amazing Race, Survivor, Masterchef, and Project Runway.

## Personal
- I am an avid Harry Potter fan
- I am an identical twin
- I do not consider myself a gamer but I do enjoy Her Interactive’s Nancy Drew Games and EA's The Sims 3
- I love (almost) all animals
- I grew up in Rochester, NY and no one will be able to convince me that Costco compares to Wegmans
